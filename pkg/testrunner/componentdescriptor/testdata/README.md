# Testdata

The ocm-repo-ctf, ocm-repo-ctf-partial-1 and ocm-repo-ctf-partial-2 ([here](./repositories)) are ocm ctf's (common 
transport archives) containing all the components present in [components](./components). The ocm library implements the 
same interface for ctf as it does for oci registries which makes it a convenient repository representation for tests.

#### All components in a single repository
Thereby, the root-component is the component described in the root-component.yaml and the other components are contained
in the ocm-repo-ctf.

The components span the following graph:

#### Components distributed over multiple repositories
In this case, the root-component is also the component described in the root-component.yaml.The union of the 
components in the partial repositories is equivalent to the components in the ocm-repo-ctf, but to resolve the entire 
dependency graph, multiple repositories have to be accessed.

**ocm-repo-ctf-partial-1:** {component-1, component-1-1, component-2-2}  
**ocm-repo-ctf-partial-2:** {component-2, component-2-1, component-3}

Generally, in both cases, the same set of components should be returned.
